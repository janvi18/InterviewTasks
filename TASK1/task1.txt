Create node project:
Initiate npm and Install express
In it we want to create simple endpoint which will get a query param called number
And whatever the number is you have to return a message as following
You have to return space separated numbers
But if the number is divisible by 3 put Fiz in pace of it
If the number is divisible by 5 put Buz in pace of it
If number is divisible by both put FixBuz in pace of it
Else put the number it self

For example if we get request /task-1?number=20, we'll return..
`1 2 Fiz 4 Buz Fiz 7 8 Fiz Buz 11 Fiz 13 14 FizBuz 16 17 Fiz 19 Buz`
